# DH-150-Assignment07

## Introduction:
Assignment 7 goes into the process of a high fidelity prototype. At this point navigation and interaction with the site should be fairly set so now the designer has the opportunity to add flare. With high fidelity prototyping the designer can begin choosing color and type while keeping accessibility and visual compatibility in mind. 

### Tasks
1. Personalize home screen in settings and return to home
2. Access the horror genre and select a show
3. Expand the recently watched menu, switch to favorites in the toolbar and “share a show”
4. Access “your feed” through the live icon in the toolbar and start watching a show

## Potential style guides:

I wanted to take a unique approach to streaming platforms. Normally streaming platforms are set on dark screens to set the ambience of night and relaxation. I attempted to choose color palettes that created the same ambiance but with lighter colors. The user should then feel relaxed but refreshed. I also followed current design trends around mental health, light colors and simple shapes.

I pursued this style guide because it resonated the most with me but also had the most neutral tones. The idea is that anyone would feel compatible with this site and would not be put off by the color combinations. Additionally I have to accommodate inconsistent images associated with the movies shows. 

## Impression test:

I tested two users, male and female, who reacted similarly showing that my site had specific and clear qualities. The users reacted in a favorable but an unexpected way to my overall design choice. Both users were clear that the site was for streaming movies/shows and that it was simple and easy to use. However, the users inferred that the site was for younger audiences, specifically children, instead of a middle aged audience. This was unexpected but I can see how my color choices may not give off a mature look and feel. 

## Accessibility color check:
Light text on dark background - White (#FFFFFF) on dark blue (#7A8F99)
3.37 - Passes AA for large text (above 18pt or bold above 14pt)
- this choice can be used for large text likes titles and decorative type but might be eligible for dense/packed information

Dark text on light background - dark purple (#503957) on light beige (#FFF8ED)
9.64 - Passes AAA level for any size text
- This choice was extremely successful legibility but since the type is so dark I might just be safe and change the type to black

Dark text on light background - grey (#707070) on light beige (#FFF8ED)
4.69 - Passes AA level for any size text and AAA for large text (above 18pt or bold above 14pt)
- Overall this choice is solid however as a designer I think I could come up with a better color combination
